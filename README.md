<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Our Conclusion

Thanks to this project we could apply what we learned during the practical work and applied different conceptes seen in class such as :

1. Data visualisation with matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
2. Data analysis with pandas and numpy
3. Machine learning with different models

But we alse learned new concepts thanks to this project such as :

1. The Django Framework
2. The collaborative plateform GitHub 
3. Working in a team
